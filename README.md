# Blog App

Welcome to the React Job Application Project! This project is a demonstration of a React application built for job application purposes, showcasing articles with search and filter functionality.

Project Overview
This React application is designed to fulfill the requirements of a job application task, which involved creating an application with articles, search, and filter functionality. While the task originally requested utilizing at least three data sources, due to time constraints (as I am currently employed elsewhere), this project utilizes a single data source to demonstrate the core functionality.

## Features

- Search articles by keyword.
- Filter articles based on categories.
- [Add more features if applicable]

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/taha1dev

2. install deps
   npm install

# or

yarn install

2. running the application
   npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Apology

I would like to express my sincere apologies for not fully meeting the task requirements. Due to my current commitments at another company, I was unable to dedicate as much time as I would have liked to this project. Consequently, I was only able to implement the functionality using one data source instead of the requested three. However, I assure you of my enthusiasm and passion for this field, and I am eager to learn and contribute more in the future.
